# technical_test

Technical Challenge
We understand your time is precious, but as discussed, we ask each applicant to take on our
small challenges. There is no right or wrong approach and we're certainly not expecting war and
peace 😊. We would expect no more than 30 minutes per challenge, if at the end of the time
you haven’t completed don’t worry just send us what you have. (Uploaded to a public GIT
repository – ensuring there is nothing KPMG sensitive in the test below there is no need for
anything to be)


Challenge #1
A 3-tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these
resources. Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the
approach, style and reproducibility.


Challenge #2
We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within AWS and provide a
json formatted output. The choice of language and implementation is up to you.
Bonus Points
The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually

Challenge #3
We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get
back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a
Hints:
We would like to see some tests. A quick read to help you along the way
We would expect it in any other language apart from elixir.
